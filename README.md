In emergency situations, locating nearby hospitals and ambulances quickly yet efficiently can be challenging. Traditional methods of finding ambulances, such as calling emergency helplines or searching online directories, can be time-consuming and unreliable. Delays in finding an available ambulance can result in critical time loss, potentially risking lives.
